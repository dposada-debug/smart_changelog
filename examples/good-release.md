# Release example (filled from template)

This is a **filled example** of release notes following [.github/RELEASE_TEMPLATE.md](.github/RELEASE_TEMPLATE.md). Use it as reference when drafting a real release.

## 🧩 What was deployed?

We shipped **release template validation** and **AI consistency review** for release notes. When you create or edit a release on GitHub, two checks run: (1) the release body must include all required sections from the template, and (2) an AI review scores the notes and flags major inconsistencies. The workflow fails clearly with actionable feedback if the score is below 40 or if major issues are detected.

## 🎯 Customer impact

Repositories using this setup get more consistent, customer-ready release notes. Fewer placeholders or incomplete sections slip through, and tone/consistency are checked automatically. For internal-only changes, release authors can still state "No direct customer impact" and explain why.

## 👀 Where will users notice it?

- **GitHub Releases UI:** When drafting or editing a release, the description field is validated after publish/edit.
- **Actions tab:** New workflows "Release Structure Check" and "Release notes AI consistency review" show pass/fail and feedback.

## 🗣 How can I explain this to a customer?

"We now run automatic checks on every release note. The note must include clear sections on what changed, how it affects you, and where you’ll see it. A second check uses AI to catch inconsistencies or missing explanations. If something doesn’t meet our bar, we fix it before the release is final—so you get clearer, more reliable release notes."

## 🏢 What other areas of the company does this affect?

- **Support:** May get fewer questions about "what actually changed" when release notes are more complete. No new workflow; existing playbooks still apply.
- **Sales/CS:** Can point to more consistent release communications. No cross-team impact otherwise.
- **Ops / Warehouse / Finance / Data:** No cross-team impact.

## 🔍 Justification

We needed a repeatable way to keep release notes aligned with our template and to catch obvious gaps or contradictions before they reach customers. Manual review wasn’t scaling. Implementing GitHub Actions for structure checks and an AI review (with a minimum score of 40) gives us a clear gate and actionable feedback without blocking on manual approval for every release.

## 📽 Demo / Evidence

- [Release Structure Check workflow](.github/workflows/release-structure-check.yml) — runs on release create/edit.
- [Release AI review workflow](.github/workflows/release-ai-review.yml) — runs on release create/edit; requires `OPENAI_API_KEY` in repo secrets.

## 🧯 Support notes / Risks

- If `OPENAI_API_KEY` is not set, the AI review step fails with instructions to add the secret; the structure check still runs.
- AI feedback is best-effort; authors should still read the notes for accuracy and tone.
